# OU Portfolio 

A small sampling of the projects I worked on as part of my undergraduate and
masters degrees from the University of Oklahoma. These span all 5 years of my
education and vary dramatically in complexity and scope. Rather than organize
them by class or year, I decided to structure them according to what field
of CS they are in.

Note: This is very much still a work in progress. As you can imagine, 5 years
of school resulted in quite a few projects; it takes a while to dig through
them all.
